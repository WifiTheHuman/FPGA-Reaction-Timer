# FPGA-Reaction-Timer
This repository contains VHDL code which describes a hardware implementation of a reaction timer. 
The FPGA will start by prompting the user 3-2-1 then begin counting up. 
When the user presses a button in reaction, the timer is paused and the reaction time is displayed on a 7-segment display.
See the hardware diagram below.
